/**
  * Extended authorizer interface for authorizers that load metadata from Kafka topics.
  * This is used to support scenarios where metadata for authorization is loaded from
  * Kafka topics using the inter-broker listener.
  * Start up sequence for this scenario is:
  *   1a) SocketServer starts up control plane listener and inter-broker listener
  *   1b) SocketServer waits for the authorizer to be initialized
  *
  *   2a) Authorizer loads its metadata from Kafka topic(s) using inter-broker listener
  *       when 1a) completes. Authorizer is now ready to authorize requests from external users.
  *   2b) Authorizer completes the future returned by [[AuthorizerWithKafkaStore#readyFuture]]
  *
  *   3) SocketServer starts the remaining listeners when 2b) completes
  *
  * Limitations:
  *  - Broker principals (and any other users of inter-broker listeners) must be authorized as
  *    super.users or using ACLs without access to metadata from Kafka topics. This makes it safe
  *    to start inter-broker listeners earlier.
